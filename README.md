# it-challenges

So i had this harmless repository [challenges](https://github.com/lvm/challenges), but one day a company named "[Devs Killer](https://devskiller.com/)" filled a DMCA because apparently i stole some of their code. The funny thing is i have no idea who they are. 

## dear devs killer,

I hope your company goes bankrupt and your code never compiles.

kind regards,
~lvm
